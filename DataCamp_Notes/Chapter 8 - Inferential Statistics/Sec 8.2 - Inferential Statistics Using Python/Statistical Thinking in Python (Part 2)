Course Description
After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

Parameter estimation by optimization
FREE
0%
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. A probability distribution that describes your data has parameters. So, a major goal of statistical inference is to estimate the values of these parameters, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.

How often do we get no-hitters?
The number of games played between each no-hitter in the modern era (1901-2015) of Major League Baseball is stored in the array nohitter_times.

If you assume that no-hitters are described as a Poisson process, then the time between no-hitters is Exponentially distributed. As you have seen, the Exponential distribution has a single parameter, which we will call τ, the typical interval time. The value of the parameter τ that makes the exponential distribution best match the data is the mean interval time (where time is in units of number of games) between no-hitters.

Compute the value of this parameter from the data. Then, use np.random.exponential() to "repeat" the history of Major League Baseball by drawing inter-no-hitter times from an exponential distribution with the τ you found and plot the histogram as an approximation to the PDF.

NumPy, pandas, matlotlib.pyplot, and seaborn have been imported for you as np, pd, plt, and sns, respectively.

Seed the random number generator with 42.
Compute the mean time (in units of number of games) between no-hitters.
Draw 100,000 samples from an Exponential distribution with the parameter you computed from the mean of the inter-no-hitter times.
Plot the theoretical PDF using plt.hist(). Remember to use keyword arguments bins=50, normed=True, and histtype='step'. Be sure to label your axes.
Show your plot.

# Seed random number generator
np.random.seed(42)

# Compute mean no-hitter time: tau
tau = np.mean(nohitter_times)

# Draw out of an exponential distribution with parameter tau: inter_nohitter_time
inter_nohitter_time = np.random.exponential(tau, 100000)

# Plot the PDF and label axes
_ = plt.hist(inter_nohitter_time,
             bins=50, normed=True, histtype='step')
_ = plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Do the data follow our story?
You have modeled no-hitters using an Exponential distribution. Create an ECDF of the real data. Overlay the theoretical CDF with the ECDF from the data. This helps you to verify that the Exponential distribution describes the observed data.

It may be helpful to remind yourself of the function you created in the previous course to compute the ECDF, as well as the code you wrote to plot it.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute an ECDF from the actual time between no-hitters (nohitter_times). Use the ecdf() function you wrote in the prequel course.
Create a CDF from the theoretical samples you took in the last exercise (inter_nohitter_time).
Plot x_theor and y_theor as a line using plt.plot(). Then overlay the ECDF of the real data x and y as points. To do this, you have to specify the keyword arguments marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x and y inside plt.plot().
Set a 2% margin on the plot.
Show the plot.

# Create an ECDF from real data: x, y
x, y = ecdf(nohitter_times)

# Create a CDF from theoretical samples: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor, y_theor = ecdf(inter_nohitter_time)

# Overlay the plots
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)
plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Margins and axis labels
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


It looks like no-hitters in the modern era of Major League Baseball are Exponentially distributed. Based on the story of the Exponential distribution, this suggests that they are a random process; when a no-hitter will happen is independent of when the last no-hitter was.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


How is this parameter optimal?
Now sample out of an exponential distribution with τ being twice as large as the optimal τ. Do it again for τ half as large. Make CDFs of these samples and overlay them with your data. You can see that they do not reproduce the data as well. Thus, the τ you computed from the mean inter-no-hitter times is optimal in that it best reproduces the data.

Note: In this and all subsequent exercises, the random number generator is pre-seeded for you to save you some typing.

Instructions
100 XP
Take 10000 samples out of an Exponential distribution with parameter τ1/2 = tau/2.

EDA of literacy/fertility data
In the next few exercises, we will look at the correlation between female literacy and fertility (defined as the average number of children born per woman) throughout the world. For ease of analysis and interpretation, we will work with the illiteracy rate.

It is always a good idea to do some EDA ahead of our analysis. To this end, plot the fertility versus illiteracy and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Numpy array illiteracy has the illiteracy rate among females for most of the world's nations. The array fertility has the corresponding fertility data.

Here, it may be useful to refer back to the function you wrote in the previous course to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Instructions
100 XP
Plot fertility (y-axis) versus illiteracy (x-axis) as a scatter plot.
Set a 2% margin.
Compute and print the Pearson correlation coefficient between illiteracy and fertility.



# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(fertility, illiteracy, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set the margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Show the Pearson correlation coefficient
print(pearson_r(fertility, illiteracy))


<script.py> output:
    0.804132402682
		

You can see the correlation between illiteracy and fertility by eye, and by the substantial Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8. It is difficult to resolve in the scatter plot, but there are many points around near-zero illiteracy and about 1.8 children/woman.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Linear regression
We will assume that fertility is a linear function of the female illiteracy rate. That is, f=ai+b, where a is the slope and b is the intercept. We can think of the intercept as the minimal fertility rate, probably somewhere between one and two. The slope tells us how the fertility rate varies with illiteracy. We can find the best fit line using np.polyfit().

Plot the data and the best fit line. Print out the slope and intercept. (Think: what are their units?)

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the slope and intercept of the regression line using np.polyfit(). Remember, fertility is on the y-axis and illiteracy on the x-axis.
Print out the slope and intercept from the linear regression.
To plot the best fit line, create an array x that consists of 0 and 100 using np.array(). Then, compute the theoretical values of y based on your regression parameters. I.e., y = a * x + b.
Plot the data and the regression line on the same plot. Be sure to label your axes.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to display your plot.


# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy, fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')

# Perform a linear regression using np.polyfit(): a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(illiteracy, fertility, deg=1)

# Print the results to the screen
print('slope =', a, 'children per woman / percent illiterate')
print('intercept =', b, 'children per woman')

# Make theoretical line to plot
x = np.array([0,100])
y = a * x + b

# Add regression line to your plot
_ = plt.plot(x, y)

# Draw the plot
plt.show()


<script.py> output:
    slope = 0.0497985480906 children per woman / percent illiterate
    intercept = 1.88805061064 children per woman

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

How is it optimal?
The function np.polyfit() that you used to get your regression parameters finds the optimal slope and intercept. It is optimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, also known as RSS (for residual sum of squares). In this exercise, you will plot the function that is being optimized, the RSS, versus the slope parameter a. To do this, fix the intercept to be what you found in the optimization. Then, plot the RSS vs. the slope. Where is it minimal?

Instructions
100 XP
Specify the values of the slope to compute the RSS. Use np.linspace() to get 200 points in the range between 0 and 0.1. For example, to get 100 points in the range between 0 and 0.5, you could use np.linspace() like so: np.linspace(0, 0.5, 100).
Initialize an array, rss, to contain the RSS using np.empty_like() and the array you created above. The empty_like() function returns a new array with the same shape and type as a given array (in this case, a_vals).
Write a for loop to compute the sum of RSS of the slope. Hint: the RSS is given by np.sum((y_data - a * x_data - b)**2). The variable b you computed in the last exercise is already in your namespace. Here, fertility is the y_data and illiteracy the x_data.
Plot the RSS (rss) versus slope (a_vals).
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Specify slopes to consider: a_vals
a_vals = np.linspace(0,0.1,200)

# Initialize sum of square of residuals: rss
rss = np.empty_like(a_vals)

# Compute sum of square of residuals for each value of a_vals
for i, a in enumerate(a_vals):
    rss[i] = np.sum((fertility - a*illiteracy - b)**2)

# Plot the RSS
plt.plot(a_vals, rss, '-')
plt.xlabel('slope (children per woman / percent illiterate)')
plt.ylabel('sum of square of residuals')

plt.show()


Great work! Notice that the minimum on the plot, that is the value of the slope that gives the minimum sum of the square of the residuals, is the same value you got when performing the regression

Linear regression on appropriate Anscombe data
For practice, perform a linear regression on the data set from Anscombe's quartet that is most reasonably interpreted with linear regression.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the parameters for the slope and intercept using np.polyfit(). The Anscombe data are stored in the arrays x and y.
Print the slope a and intercept b.
Generate theoretical x and y data from the linear regression. Your x array, which you can create with np.array(), should consist of 3 and 15. To generate the y data, multiply the slope by x_theor and add the intercept.
Plot the Anscombe data as a scatter plot and then plot the theoretical line. Remember to include the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments in addition to x and y when to plot the Anscombe data as a scatter plot. You do not need these arguments when plotting the theoretical line.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!

# Perform linear regression: a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,deg=1)

# Print the slope and intercept
print(a, b)

# Generate theoretical x and y data: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor = np.array([3, 15])
y_theor = x_theor * a + b

# Plot the Anscombe data and theoretical line
_ = plt.plot(x,y,marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_theor,y_theor,marker='.', linestyle='none')

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Linear regression on all Anscombe data
Now, to verify that all four of the Anscombe data sets have the same slope and intercept from a linear regression, you will compute the slope and intercept for each set. The data are stored in lists; anscombe_x = [x1, x2, x3, x4] and anscombe_y = [y1, y2, y3, y4], where, for example, x2 and y2 are the x and y values for the second Anscombe data set.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a for loop to do the following for each Anscombe data set.
Compute the slope and intercept.
Print the slope and intercept.

# Iterate through x,y pairs
for x, y in zip(anscombe_x, anscombe_y):
    # Compute the slope and intercept: a, b
    a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,deg=1)

    # Print the result
    print('slope:', a, 'intercept:', b)

Bootstrap confidence intervals
0%
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.



Bootstrapping
● The use of resampled data to
perform statistical inference


Bootstrap sample
● A resampled array of the data

Bootstrap replicate
● A statistic computed from a resampled array


Resampling engine: np.random.choice()
In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: np.random.choice([1,2,3,4,5], size=5)
Out[2]: array([5, 3, 5, 5, 2])



Computing a bootstrap replicate
In [1]: bs_sample = np.random.choice(michelson_speed_of_light,
 ...: size=100)
In [2]: np.mean(bs_sample)
Out[2]: 299847.79999999999
In [3]: np.median(bs_sample)
Out[3]: 299845.0
In [4]: np.std(bs_sample)
Out[4]: 83.564286025729331


Getting the terminology down
Getting tripped up over terminology is a common cause of frustration in students. Unfortunately, you often will read and hear other data scientists using different terminology for bootstrap samples and replicates. This is even more reason why we need everything to be clear and consistent for this course. So, before going forward discussing bootstrapping, let's get our terminology down. If we have a data set with n repeated measurements, a bootstrap sample is an array of length n that was drawn from the original data with replacement. What is a bootstrap replicate?

A single value of a statistic computed from a bootstrap sample.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Bootstrapping by hand
To help you gain intuition about how bootstrapping works, imagine you have a data set that has only three points, [-1, 0, 1]. How many unique bootstrap samples can be drawn (e.g., [-1, 0, 1] and [1, 0, -1] are unique), and what is the maximum mean you can get from a bootstrap sample? It might be useful to jot down the samples on a piece of paper.

(These are too few data to get meaningful results from bootstrap procedures, but this example is useful for intuition.)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Visualizing bootstrap samples
In this exercise, you will generate bootstrap samples from the set of annual rainfall data measured at the Sheffield Weather Station in the UK from 1883 to 2015. The data are stored in the NumPy array rainfall in units of millimeters (mm). By graphically displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF, you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.
Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).
Use the function ecdf() that you wrote in the prequel to this course to generate the x and y values for the ECDF of the bootstrap sample bs_sample.
Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Use ecdf() to generate x and y values for the ECDF of the original rainfall data available in the array rainfall.
Plot the ECDF values of the original data.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the samples!

for _ in range(50):
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))

    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)

# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')

# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Generating many bootstrap replicates
The function bootstrap_replicate_1d() from the video is available in your namespace. Now you'll write another function, draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1), which generates many bootstrap replicates from the data set. This function will come in handy for you again and again as you compute confidence intervals and later when you do hypothesis tests.

For your reference, the bootstrap_replicate_1d() function is provided below:

def bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func):
    return func(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data)))
Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1).
Using np.empty(), initialize an array called bs_replicates of size size to hold all of the bootstrap replicates.
Write a for loop that ranges over size and computes a replicate using bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Refer to the exercise description above to see the function signature of bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Store the replicate in the appropriate index of bs_replicates.
Return the array of replicates bs_replicates. This has already been done for you.


def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    """Draw bootstrap replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_replicates[i] =  bootstrap_replicate_1d(data,func)  

    return bs_replicates

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Bootstrap replicates of the mean and the SEM
In this exercise, you will compute a bootstrap estimate of the probability density function of the mean annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station. Remember, we are estimating the mean annual rainfall we would get if the Sheffield Weather Station could repeat all of the measurements from 1883 to 2015 over and over again. This is a probabilistic estimate of the mean. You will plot the PDF as a histogram, and you will see that it is Normal.

In fact, it can be shown theoretically that under not-too-restrictive conditions, the value of the mean will always be Normally distributed. (This does not hold in general, just for the mean and a few other statistics.) The standard deviation of this distribution, called the standard error of the mean, or SEM, is given by the standard deviation of the data divided by the square root of the number of data points. I.e., for a data set, sem = np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)). Using hacker statistics, you get this same result without the need to derive it, but you will verify this result from your bootstrap replicates.

The dataset has been pre-loaded for you into an array called rainfall.

Instructions

Instructions

Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the mean annual rainfall using your draw_bs_reps() function and the rainfall array. Hint: Pass in np.mean for func to compute the mean.
As a reminder, draw_bs_reps() accepts 3 arguments: data, func, and size.
Compute and print the standard error of the mean of rainfall.
The formula to compute this is np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)).
Compute and print the standard deviation of your bootstrap replicates bs_replicates.
Make a histogram of the replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute and print SEM
sem = np.std(rainfall) / np.sqrt(len(rainfall))
print(sem)

# Compute and print standard deviation of bootstrap replicates
bs_std = np.std(bs_replicates)
print(bs_std)

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('mean annual rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


Great work! Notice that the SEM we got from the known expression and the bootstrap replicates is the same and the distribution of the bootstrap replicates of the mean is Normal.


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Confidence intervals of rainfall data
A confidence interval gives upper and lower bounds on the range of parameter values you might expect to get if we repeat our measurements. For named distributions, you can compute them analytically or look them up, but one of the many beautiful properties of the bootstrap method is that you can take percentiles of your bootstrap replicates to get your confidence interval. Conveniently, you can use the np.percentile() function.

Use the bootstrap replicates you just generated to compute the 95% confidence interval. That is, give the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of your bootstrap replicates stored as bs_replicates. What is the 95% confidence interval?


In [1]: np.percentile(bs_replicates, 97.5)
Out[1]: 820.95043233082697

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Bootstrap replicates of other statistics
We saw in a previous exercise that the mean is Normally distributed. This does not necessarily hold for other statistics, but no worry: as hackers, we can always take bootstrap replicates! In this exercise, you'll generate bootstrap replicates for the variance of the annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station and plot the histogram of the replicates.

Here, you will make use of the draw_bs_reps() function you defined a few exercises ago. It is provided below for your reference:

def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    return np.array([bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func) for _ in range(size)])
Instructions
100 XP
Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the variance in annual rainfall, stored in the rainfall dataset, using your draw_bs_reps() function. Hint: Pass in np.var for computing the variance.
Divide your variance replicates (bs_replicates) by 100 to put the variance in units of square centimeters for convenience.
Make a histogram of bs_replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.

# Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the variance: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall, np.var,size=10000)

# Put the variance in units of square centimeters
bs_replicates = bs_replicates/100

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('variance of annual rainfall (sq. cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Great work! This is not normally distributed, as it has a longer tail to the right. Note that you can also compute a confidence interval on the variance, or any other statistic, using np.percentile() with your bootstrap replicates.

Confidence interval on the rate of no-hitters
Consider again the inter-no-hitter intervals for the modern era of baseball. Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the optimal parameter τ. Plot a histogram of your replicates and report a 95% confidence interval.

Instructions
100 XP
Generate 10000 bootstrap replicates of τ from the nohitter_times data using your draw_bs_reps() function. Recall that the the optimal τ is calculated as the mean of the data.
Compute the 95% confidence interval using np.percentile() and passing in two arguments: The array bs_replicates, and the list of percentiles - in this case 2.5 and 97.5.
Print the confidence interval.
Plot a histogram of your bootstrap replicates. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!


# Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates,[2.5,97.5])

# Print the confidence interval
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games')

# Plot the histogram of the replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel(r'$\tau$ (games)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


This gives you an estimate of what the typical time between no-hitters is. It could be anywhere between 660 and 870 games.

A function to do pairs bootstrap
As discussed in the video, pairs bootstrap involves resampling pairs of data. Each collection of pairs fit with a line, in this case using np.polyfit(). We do this again and again, getting bootstrap replicates of the parameter values. To have a useful tool for doing pairs bootstrap, you will write a function to perform pairs bootstrap on a set of x,y data.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1) to perform pairs bootstrap estimates on linear regression parameters.
Use np.arange() to set up an array of indices going from 0 to len(x). These are what you will resample and use them to pick values out of the x and y arrays.
Use np.empty() to initialize the slope and intercept replicate arrays to be of size size.
Write a for loop to:
Resample the indices inds. Use np.random.choice() to do this.
Make new x and y arrays bs_x and bs_y using the the resampled indices bs_inds. To do this, slice x and y with bs_inds.
Use np.polyfit() on the new x and y arrays and store the computed slope and intercept.
Return the pair bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept.


def draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for linear regression."""

    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))

    # Initialize replicates: bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
    bs_slope_reps = np.empty(size)
    bs_intercept_reps = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, size=len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[bs_inds], y[bs_inds]
        bs_slope_reps[i], bs_intercept_reps[i] = np.polyfit(bs_x,bs_y,1)

    return bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps

Pairs bootstrap of literacy/fertility data
Using the function you just wrote, perform pairs bootstrap to plot a histogram describing the estimate of the slope from the illiteracy/fertility data. Also report the 95% confidence interval of the slope. The data is available to you in the NumPy arrays illiteracy and fertility.

As a reminder, draw_bs_pairs_linreg() has a function signature of draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1), and it returns two values: bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps.

Instructions
100 XP
Use your draw_bs_pairs_linreg() function to take 1000 bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept. The x-axis data is illiteracy and y-axis data is fertility.
Compute and print the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the slope.
Plot and show a histogram of the slope replicates. Be sure to label your axes. This has been done for you, so click 'Submit Answer' to see your histogram!


# Generate replicates of slope and intercept using pairs bootstrap

    Plotting bootstrap regressions
A nice way to visualize the variability we might expect in a linear regression is to plot the line you would get from each bootstrap replicate of the slope and intercept. Do this for the first 100 of your bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept (stored as bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps).

Instructions
100 XP
Generate an array of x-values consisting of 0 and 100 for the plot of the regression lines. Use the np.array() function for this.
Write a for loop in which you plot a regression line with a slope and intercept given by the pairs bootstrap replicates. Do this for 100 lines.
When plotting the regression lines in each iteration of the for loop, recall the regression equation y = a*x + b. Here, a is bs_slope_reps[i] and b is bs_intercept_reps[i].
Specify the keyword arguments linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, and color='red' in your call to plt.plot().
Make a scatter plot with illiteracy on the x-axis and fertility on the y-axis. Remember to specify the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Label the axes, set a 2% margin, and show the plot. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the bootstrap regressions!

# Generate array of x-values for bootstrap lines: x

You now know how to define and estimate parameters given a model. But the question remains: how reasonable is it to observe your data if a model is true? This question is addressed by hypothesis tests. They are the icing on the inference cake. After completing this chapter, you will be able to carefully construct and test hypotheses using hacker statistics.

Generating a permutation sample
In the video, you learned that permutation sampling is a great way to simulate the hypothesis that two variables have identical probability distributions. This is often a hypothesis you want to test, so in this exercise, you will write a function to generate a permutation sample from two data sets.

Remember, a permutation sample of two arrays having respectively n1 and n2 entries is constructed by concatenating the arrays together, scrambling the contents of the concatenated array, and then taking the first n1 entries as the permutation sample of the first array and the last n2 entries as the permutation sample of the second array.

Instructions
100 XP
Concatenate the two input arrays into one using np.concatenate(). Be sure to pass in data1 and data2 as one argument (data1, data2).
Use np.random.permutation() to permute the concatenated array.
Store the first len(data1) entries of permuted_data as perm_sample_1 and the last len(data2) entries of permuted_data as perm_sample_2. In practice, this can be achieved by using :len(data1) and len(data1): to slice permuted_data.
Return perm_sample_1 and perm_sample_2.


def permutation_sample(data1, data2):
    """Generate a permutation sample from two data sets."""

    # Concatenate the data sets: data
    data = np.concatenate((data1,data2))

    # Permute the concatenated array: permuted_data
    permuted_data = np.random.permutation(data)

    # Split the permuted array into two: perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2
    perm_sample_1 = permuted_data[:len(data1)]
    perm_sample_2 = permuted_data[len(data1):]

    return perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



Visualizing permutation sampling
To help see how permutation sampling works, in this exercise you will generate permutation samples and look at them graphically.

We will use the Sheffield Weather Station data again, this time considering the monthly rainfall in July (a dry month) and November (a wet month). We expect these might be differently distributed, so we will take permutation samples to see how their ECDFs would look if they were identically distributed.

The data are stored in the Numpy arrays rain_june and rain_november.

As a reminder, permutation_sample() has a function signature of permutation_sample(data_1, data_2) with a return value of permuted_data[:len(data_1)], permuted_data[len(data_1):], where permuted_data = np.random.permutation(np.concatenate((data_1, data_2))).

Instructions

Write a for loop to 50 generate permutation samples, compute their ECDFs, and plot them.
Generate a permutation sample pair from rain_june and rain_november using your permutation_sample() function.
Generate the x and y values for an ECDF for each of the two permutation samples for the ECDF using your ecdf() function.
Plot the ECDF of the first permutation sample (x_1 and y_1) as dots. Do the same for the second permutation sample (x_2 and y_2).
Generate x and y values for ECDFs for the rain_june and rain_november data and plot the ECDFs using respectively the keyword arguments color='red' and color='blue'.
Label your axes, set a 2% margin, and show your plot. This has been done for you, so just hit 'Submit Answer' to view the plot!


for _ in range(50):
    # Generate permutation samples
    perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(rain_june, rain_november)


    # Compute ECDFs
    x_1, y_1 = ecdf(perm_sample_1)
    x_2, y_2 = ecdf(perm_sample_2)

    # Plot ECDFs of permutation sample
    _ = plt.plot(x_1, y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='red', alpha=0.02)
    _ = plt.plot(x_2, y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='blue', alpha=0.02)

# Create and plot ECDFs from original data
x_1, y_1 = ecdf(rain_june)
x_2, y_2 = ecdf(rain_november)
_ = plt.plot(x_1, y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='red')
_ = plt.plot(x_2, y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='blue')

# Label axes, set margin, and show plot
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('monthly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()



Great work! Notice that the permutation samples ECDFs overlap and give a purple haze. None of the ECDFs from the permutation samples overlap with the observed data, suggesting that the hypothesis is not commensurate with the data. July and November rainfall are not identically distributed.

Generating permutation replicates
As discussed in the video, a permutation replicate is a single value of a statistic computed from a permutation sample. As the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2 is useful for you to generate bootstrap replicates, it is useful to have a similar function, draw_perm_reps(), to generate permutation replicates. You will write this useful function in this exercise.

The function has call signature draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1). Importantly, func must be a function that takes two arrays as arguments. In most circumstances, func will be a function you write yourself.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with this signature: draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1).
Initialize an array to hold the permutation replicates using np.empty().
Write a for loop to:
Compute a permutation sample using your permutation_sample() function
Pass the sample into func to compute the replicate and store the result in your array of replicates.
Return the array of replicates.



def draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1):
    """Generate multiple permutation replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
    perm_replicates = np.empty(size)

    for i in range(size):
        # Generate permutation sample
        perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(data_1, data_2)

        # Compute the test statistic
        perm_replicates[i] = func(perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2)

    return perm_replicates

    Look before you leap: EDA before hypothesis testing
Kleinteich and Gorb (Sci. Rep., 4, 5225, 2014) performed an interesting experiment with South American horned frogs. They held a plate connected to a force transducer, along with a bait fly, in front of them. They then measured the impact force and adhesive force of the frog's tongue when it struck the target.

Frog A is an adult and Frog B is a juvenile. The researchers measured the impact force of 20 strikes for each frog. In the next exercise, we will test the hypothesis that the two frogs have the same distribution of impact forces. But, remember, it is important to do EDA first! Let's make a bee swarm plot for the data. They are stored in a Pandas data frame, df, where column ID is the identity of the frog and column impact_force is the impact force in Newtons (N).

Instructions
100 XP
Use sns.swarmplot() to make a bee swarm plot of the data by specifying the x, y, and data keyword arguments.
Label your axes.
Show the plot.


    
    # Make bee swarm plot
_ = sns.swarmplot(data=df, x= 'ID', y='impact_force')

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('frog')
_ = plt.ylabel('impact force (N)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


Eyeballing it, it does not look like they come from the same distribution. Frog A, the adult, has three or four very hard strikes, and Frog B, the juvenile, has a couple weak ones. However, it is possible that with only 20 samples it might be too difficult to tell if they have difference distributions, so we should proceed with the hypothesis test.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Permutation test on frog data
The average strike force of Frog A was 0.71 Newtons (N), and that of Frog B was 0.42 N for a difference of 0.29 N. It is possible the frogs strike with the same force and this observed difference was by chance. You will compute the probability of getting at least a 0.29 N difference in mean strike force under the hypothesis that the distributions of strike forces for the two frogs are identical. We use a permutation test with a test statistic of the difference of means to test this hypothesis.

For your convenience, the data has been stored in the arrays force_a and force_b.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature diff_of_means(data_1, data_2) that returns the differences in means between two data sets, mean of data_1 minus mean of data_2.
Use this function to compute the empirical difference of means that was observed in the frogs.
Draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the difference of means.
Compute the p-value.
Print the p-value.


def diff_of_means(data_1, data_2):
    """Difference in means of two arrays."""

    # The difference of means of data_1, data_2: diff
    diff = np.mean(data_1) - np.mean(data_2)

    return diff

# Compute difference of mean impact force from experiment: empirical_diff_means
empirical_diff_means = diff_of_means(force_a, force_b)

# Draw 10,000 permutation replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = draw_perm_reps(force_a, force_b,
                                 diff_of_means, size=10000)

# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= empirical_diff_means) / len(perm_replicates)

# Print the result
print('p-value =', p)



<script.py> output:
    p-value = 0.0063


The p-value tells you that there is about a 0.6% chance that you would get the difference of means observed in the experiment if frogs were exactly the same. A p-value below 0.01 is typically said to be "statistically significant," but: warning! warning! warning! You have computed a p-value; it is a number. I encourage you not to distill it to a yes-or-no phrase. p = 0.006 and p = 0.000000006 are both said to be "statistically significant," but they are definitely not the same!

A one-sample bootstrap hypothesis test
Another juvenile frog was studied, Frog C, and you want to see if Frog B and Frog C have similar impact forces. Unfortunately, you do not have Frog C's impact forces available, but you know they have a mean of 0.55 N. Because you don't have the original data, you cannot do a permutation test, and you cannot assess the hypothesis that the forces from Frog B and Frog C come from the same distribution. You will therefore test another, less restrictive hypothesis: The mean strike force of Frog B is equal to that of Frog C.

To set up the bootstrap hypothesis test, you will take the mean as our test statistic. Remember, your goal is to calculate the probability of getting a mean impact force less than or equal to what was observed for Frog B if the hypothesis that the true mean of Frog B's impact forces is equal to that of Frog C is true. You first translate all of the data of Frog B such that the mean is 0.55 N. This involves adding the mean force of Frog C and subtracting the mean force of Frog B from each measurement of Frog B. This leaves other properties of Frog B's distribution, such as the variance, unchanged.

Translate the impact forces of Frog B such that its mean is 0.55 N.
Use your draw_bs_reps() function to take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean of your translated forces.
Compute the p-value by finding the fraction of your bootstrap replicates that are less than the observed mean impact force of Frog B. Note that the variable of interest here is force_b.
Print your p-value.

# Make an array of translated impact forces: translated_force_b
translated_force_b = force_b - np.mean(force_b)+0.55

# Take bootstrap replicates of Frog B's translated impact forces: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(translated_force_b, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute fraction of replicates that are less than the observed Frog B force: p
p = np.sum(bs_replicates <= np.mean(force_b)) / 10000

# Print the p-value
print('p = ', p)


<script.py> output:
    p =  0.0046
    
    
  Great work! The low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis that Frog B and Frog C have the same mean impact force is false.
  
  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  
  
A two-sample bootstrap hypothesis test for difference of means
We now want to test the hypothesis that Frog A and Frog B have the same mean impact force, but not necessarily the same distribution, which is also impossible with a permutation test.

To do the two-sample bootstrap test, we shift both arrays to have the same mean, since we are simulating the hypothesis that their means are, in fact, equal. We then draw bootstrap samples out of the shifted arrays and compute the difference in means. This constitutes a bootstrap replicate, and we generate many of them. The p-value is the fraction of replicates with a difference in means greater than or equal to what was observed.

The objects forces_concat and empirical_diff_means are already in your namespace.

Compute the bootstrap replicates of the difference of means by subtracting the replicates of the shifted impact force of Frog B from those of Frog A.
Compute and print the p-value from your bootstrap replicates.



# Compute mean of all forces: mean_force

Nice work! You got a similar result as when you did the permutation test. Nonetheless, remember that it is important to carefully think about what question you want to ask. Are you only interested in the mean impact force, or in the distribution of impact forces?

As you saw from the last chapter, hypothesis testing can be a bit tricky. You need to define the null hypothesis, figure out how to simulate it, and define clearly what it means to be "more extreme" in order to compute the p-value. Like any skill, practice makes perfect, and this chapter gives you some good practice with hypothesis tests.

The vote for the Civil Rights Act in 1964
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed in the USA. Excluding "present" and "abstain" votes, 153 House Democrats and 136 Republicans voted yea. However, 91 Democrats and 35 Republicans voted nay. Did party affiliation make a difference in the vote?

To answer this question, you will evaluate the hypothesis that the party of a House member has no bearing on his or her vote. You will use the fraction of Democrats voting in favor as your test statistic and evaluate the probability of observing a fraction of Democrats voting in favor at least as small as the observed fraction of 153/244. (That's right, at least as small as. In 1964, it was the Democrats who were less progressive on civil rights issues.) To do this, permute the party labels of the House voters and then arbitrarily divide them into "Democrats" and "Republicans" and compute the fraction of Democrats voting yea.

Instructions

Construct Boolean arrays, dems and reps that contain the votes of the respective parties; e.g., dems has 153 True entries and 91 False entries.
Write a function, frac_yea_dems(dems, reps) that returns the fraction of Democrats that voted yea. The first input is an array of Booleans, Two inputs are required to use your draw_perm_reps() function, but the second is not used.
Use your draw_perm_reps() function to draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the fraction of Democrat yea votes.
Compute and print the p-value.


# Construct arrays of data: dems, reps
dems = np.array([True] * 153 + [False] * 91)

    return frac

# Acquire permutation samples: perm_replicates

# Compute and print p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates <= 153/244) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)

<script.py> output:

 Great work! This small p-value suggests that party identity had a lot to do with the voting. Importantly, the South had a higher fraction of Democrat representatives, and consequently also a more racist bias.   


Hint
You can initialize an array with np.array(). For example, the statement np.array([True] * 5 + [False] * 3) creates a Boolean array with 5 True entries and 3 False entries.
A 'yea' vote, in Boolean terms, is represented as a 1, or a True, while a 'nay' is represented as a 0, or a False. To calculate the fraction of Democrats that voted 'yea', you can add all the entries in your dems array with np.sum, and divide it by the total number of entries (which you can calculate with len()).
In draw_perm_reps(), the func argument should be the function you wrote above. Recall that the other arguments needed are your two arrays and the number of permutation replicates you want to draw.
The p-value can be computed by calculating the fraction of perm_samples that are <= the value returned by frac_yea_dems (which also happens to be the mean of Democrat votes). This can be done by appropriately using np.sum() in the numerator and len() in the denominator.

A time-on-website analog
It turns out that you already did a hypothesis test analogous to an A/B test where you are interested in how much time is spent on the website before and after an ad campaign. The frog tongue force (a continuous quantity like time on the website) is an analog. "Before" = Frog A and "after" = Frog B. Let's practice this again with something that actually is a before/after scenario.

We return to the no-hitter data set. In 1920, Major League Baseball implemented important rule changes that ended the so-called dead ball era. Importantly, the pitcher was no longer allowed to spit on or scuff the ball, an activity that greatly favors pitchers. In this problem you will perform an A/B test to determine if these rule changes resulted in a slower rate of no-hitters (i.e., longer average time between no-hitters) using the difference in mean inter-no-hitter time as your test statistic. The inter-no-hitter times for the respective eras are stored in the arrays nht_dead and nht_live, where "nht" is meant to stand for "no-hitter time."

Since you will be using your draw_perm_reps() function in this exercise, it may be useful to remind yourself of its call signature: draw_perm_reps(d1, d2, func, size=1) or even referring back to the chapter 3 exercise in which you defined it.

Compute the observed difference in mean inter-nohitter time using diff_of_means().
Generate 10,000 permutation replicates of the difference of means using draw_perm_reps().
Compute and print the p-value.



# Compute the observed difference in mean inter-no-hitter times: nht_diff_obs
nht_diff_obs = diff_of_means(nht_dead, nht_live)

# Acquire 10,000 permutation replicates of difference in mean no-hitter time: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = draw_perm_reps(nht_dead, nht_live, diff_of_means, 10000)


# Compute and print the p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates <= nht_diff_obs) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-val =', p)

Your p-value is 0.0001, which means that only one out of your 10,000 replicates had a result as extreme as the actual difference between the dead ball and live ball eras. This suggests strong statistical significance. Watch out, though, you could very well have gotten zero replicates that were as extreme as the observed value. This just means that the p-value is quite small, almost certainly smaller than 0.001.



<script.py> output:
    p-val = 0.0001

Test of correlation


Hypothesis test of correlation
● Posit null hypothesis: the two variables are completely
uncorrelated
● Simulate data assuming null hypothesis is true
● Use Pearson correlation, ρ, as test statistic
● Compute p-value as fraction of replicates that have ρ
at least as large as observed. 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Simulating a null hypothesis concerning correlation
The observed correlation between female illiteracy and fertility in the data set of 162 countries may just be by chance; the fertility of a given country may actually be totally independent of its illiteracy. You will test this null hypothesis in the next exercise.

To do the test, you need to simulate the data assuming the null hypothesis is true. Of the following choices, which is the best way to to do it?

Answer: Do a permutation test: Permute the illiteracy values but leave the fertility values fixed to generate a new set of (illiteracy, fertility) data.


Yes, this exactly simulates the null hypothesis and does so more efficiently than the last option. It is exact because it uses all data and eliminates any correlation because which illiteracy value pairs to which fertility value is shuffled.

Hypothesis test on Pearson correlation
The observed correlation between female illiteracy and fertility may just be by chance; the fertility of a given country may actually be totally independent of its illiteracy. You will test this hypothesis. To do so, permute the illiteracy values but leave the fertility values fixed. This simulates the hypothesis that they are totally independent of each other. For each permutation, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and assess how many of your permutation replicates have a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than the observed one.

The function pearson_r() that you wrote in the prequel to this course for computing the Pearson correlation coefficient is already in your name space.

Write a for loop to draw 10,000 replicates:
Permute the illiteracy measurements using np.random.permutation().
Compute the Pearson correlation between the permuted illiteracy array, illiteracy_permuted, and fertility.
Compute and print the p-value from the replicates.


# Compute observed correlation: r_obs
r_obs = pearson_r(illiteracy, fertility)

# Initialize permutation replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):
    # Permute illiteracy measurments: illiteracy_permuted
    illiteracy_permuted = np.random.permutation(illiteracy)

    # Compute Pearson correlation
    perm_replicates[i] = pearson_r(illiteracy_permuted, fertility)

# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= r_obs) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-val =', p)

You got a p-value of zero. In hacker statistics, this means that your p-value is very low, since you never got a single replicate in the 10,000 you took that had a Pearson correlation greater than the observed one. You could try increasing the number of replicates you take to continue to move the upper bound on your p-value lower and lower.

    Do neonicotinoid insecticides have unintended consequences?
As a final exercise in hypothesis testing before we put everything together in our case study in the next chapter, you will investigate the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bee reproduction. These insecticides are very widely used in the United States to combat aphids and other pests that damage plants.

In a recent study, Straub, et al. (Proc. Roy. Soc. B, 2016) investigated the effects of neonicotinoids on the sperm of pollinating bees. In this and the next exercise, you will study how the pesticide treatment affected the count of live sperm per half milliliter of semen.

First, we will do EDA, as usual. Plot ECDFs of the alive sperm count for untreated bees (stored in the Numpy array control) and bees treated with pesticide (stored in the Numpy array treated).

    Nice plot! The ECDFs show a pretty clear difference between the treatment and control; treated bees have fewer alive sperm. Let's now do a hypothesis test in the next exercise.

  Bootstrap hypothesis test on bee sperm counts
Now, you will test the following hypothesis: On average, male bees treated with neonicotinoid insecticide have the same number of active sperm per milliliter of semen than do untreated male bees. You will use the difference of means as your test statistic.

p = np.sum(bs_replicates >= np.mean(control) - np.mean(treated)) \
            / len(bs_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)

    
    Nice work! The p-value is small, most likely less than 0.0001, since you never saw a bootstrap replicated with a difference of means at least as extreme as what was observed. In fact, when I did the calculation with 10 million replicates, I got a p-value of 2e-05.
    
    
    Hint
You can use the np.mean() function to individually compute the means of control and treated. Take the difference of these and store the result in diff_means.
To pool the data, you need to first concatenate control and treated by passing them in as arguments to np.concatenate(). Then, you can take the mean of the pooled data with np.mean().
Inside the draw_bs_reps() function, you need to pass in the shifted data arrays for control and treated. The arguments for func and size have already been specified for you.
Subtract the replicates of the shifted treated data set from that of the shifted control data set to compute the bootstrap replicates of the difference of means.

Putting it all together: a case study
0%
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!

Darwin's finches:

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches
For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.

In the next few problems, you will look at the beak depth of G. scandens on Daphne Major in 1975 and in 2012. To start with, let's plot all of the beak depth measurements in 1975 and 2012 in a bee swarm plot.

The data are stored in a pandas DataFrame called df with columns 'year' and 'beak_depth'. The units of beak depth are millimeters (mm).

Instructions
100 XP
Create the beeswarm plot.
Label the axes.
Show the plot.


# Create bee swarm plot
_ = sns.swarmplot(x='year',y='beak_depth',data=df)

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('year')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

It is kind of hard to see if there is a clear difference between the 1975 and 2012 data set. Eyeballing it, it appears as though the mean of the 2012 data set might be slightly higher, and it might have a bigger variance.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ECDFs of beak depths
While bee swarm plots are useful, we found that ECDFs are often even better when doing EDA. Plot the ECDFs for the 1975 and 2012 beak depth measurements on the same plot.

For your convenience, the beak depths for the respective years has been stored in the NumPy arrays bd_1975 and bd_2012.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the ECDF for the 1975 and 2012 data.

# Compute ECDFs
x_1975, y_1975 = ecdf(bd_1975)
x_2012, y_2012 = ecdf(bd_2012)

# Plot the ECDFs
_ = plt.plot(x_1975, y_1975, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_2012, y_2012, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set margins
plt.margins(0.02)

# Add axis labels and legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='lower right')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


The differences are much clearer in the ECDF. The mean is larger in the 2012 data, and the variance does appear larger as well.

Parameter estimates of beak depths
Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.

Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.

Compute the difference of the sample means.
Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 1975 beak depths using your draw_bs_reps() function. Also get 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 2012 beak depths.
Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference of means.
Use the replicates to compute the 95% confidence interval.

bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute samples of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_diff_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])

# Print the results
print('difference of means =', mean_diff, 'mm')
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'mm')


<script.py> output:
    difference of means = 0.226220472441 mm
    95% confidence interval = [ 0.05633521  0.39190544] mm
    
    
Hint
Use np.mean() to calculate the sample means of bd_1975 and bd_2012, and store the difference between them in mean_diff.
Use the draw_bs_reps() function with np.mean as the func argument to generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of bd_1975 and bd_2012.
To get the bootstrap replicates of the difference of means, compute the difference between bs_replicates_2012 and bs_replicates_1975.
Recall that you can use np.percentile() to calculate confidence intervals. For a 95% confidence interval, you would pass in the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles in the form of a list as an argument to np.percentile().
The print statements have already been written for you, so just hit 'Submit Answer' after computing the 95% confidence interval.

Hypothesis test: Are beaks deeper in 2012?
Your plot of the ECDF and determination of the confidence interval make it pretty clear that the beaks of G. scandens on Daphne Major have gotten deeper. But is it possible that this effect is just due to random chance? In other words, what is the probability that we would get the observed difference in mean beak depth if the means were the same?

Be careful! The hypothesis we are testing is not that the beak depths come from the same distribution. For that we could use a permutation test. The hypothesis is that the means are equal. To perform this hypothesis test, we need to shift the two data sets so that they have the same mean and then use bootstrap sampling to compute the difference of means.

Make a concatenated array of the 1975 and 2012 beak depths and compute and store its mean.
Shift bd_1975 and bd_2012 such that their means are equal to the one you just computed for the combined data set.
Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean each for the 1975 and 2012 beak depths.
Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference.
Compute and print the p-value. The observed difference in means you computed in the last exercise is still in your namespace as mean_diff.


# Compute mean of combined data set: combined_mean
combined_mean = np.mean(np.concatenate((bd_1975, bd_2012)))

# Shift the samples
bd_1975_shifted = bd_1975 - np.mean(bd_1975) + combined_mean
bd_2012_shifted = bd_2012 - np.mean(bd_2012) + combined_mean

# Get bootstrap replicates of shifted data sets
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975_shifted,np.mean, size=10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012_shifted,np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute replicates of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute the p-value
p = np.sum(bs_diff_replicates >= mean_diff) / len(bs_diff_replicates)

# Print p-value
print('p =', p)


We get a p-value of 0.0034, which suggests that there is a statistically significant difference. But remember: it is very important to know how different they are! In the previous exercise, you got a difference of 0.2 mm between the means. You should combine this with the statistical significance. Changing by 0.2 mm in 37 years is substantial by evolutionary standards. If it kept changing at that rate, the beak depth would double in only 400 years.


Hint
First concatenate bd_1975 and bd_2012 with np.concatenate(), and then take the mean of this concatenated array with np.mean().
To shift bd_1975 and bd_2012 as described in the instructions, you should subtract their individual means from themselves and add the combined_mean you calculated above.
Since you need the bootstrap replicates of the mean, the argument to the func parameter of draw_bs_reps() should be np.mean.
To get bootstrap replicates of the difference, compute the difference between bs_replicates_2012 and bs_replicates_1975.
To compute the p-value, calculate the fraction of bs_diff_replicates that are greater than or equal to the observed difference in means you calculated in the previous exercise (mean_diff).

EDA of beak length and depth
The beak length data are stored as bl_1975 and bl_2012, again with units of millimeters (mm). You still have the beak depth data stored in bd_1975 and bd_2012. Make scatter plots of beak depth (y-axis) versus beak length (x-axis) for the 1975 and 2012 specimens.

Instructions
100 XP
Make a scatter plot of the 1975 data. Use the color='blue' keyword argument. Also use an alpha=0.5 keyword argument to have transparency in case data points overlap.
Do the same for the 2012 data, but use the color='red' keyword argument.
Add a legend and label the axes.
Show your plot.


# Make scatter plot of 1975 data
_ = plt.plot(bl_1975, bd_1975, marker='.',
             linestyle='none', color='blue', alpha=0.5)

# Make scatter plot of 2012 data

_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')

Great work! In looking at the plot, we see that beaks got deeper (the red points are higher up in the y-direction), but not really longer. If anything, they got a bit shorter, since the red dots are to the left of the blue dots. So, it does not look like the beaks kept the same shape; they became shorter and deeper.

Beak length to depth ratio
The linear regressions showed interesting information about the beak geometry. The slope was the same in 1975 and 2012, suggesting that for every millimeter gained in beak length, the birds gained about half a millimeter in depth in both years. However, if we are interested in the shape of the beak, we want to compare the ratio of beak length to beak depth. Let's make that comparison.

Remember, the data are stored in bd_1975, bd_2012, bl_1975, and bl_2012.

# Compute length-to-depth ratios

ratio_2012 = np.array(bl_2012/bd_2012)

# Compute means

How different is the ratio?
In the previous exercise, you computed the mean beak length to depth ratio with 99% confidence intervals for 1975 and for 2012. The results of that calculation are shown graphically in the plot accompanying this problem. In addition to these results, what would you say about the ratio of beak length to depth?

It is impossible to say if this is a real effect or just due to noise without computing a p-value. Let me compute the p-value and get back to you.

Calculation of
heredity

Heredity - ● The tendency for parental traits to
be inherited by offspring


Summary:
● Perform EDA
● Generate effective plots like ECDFs
● Compute summary statistics
● Estimate parameters
● By optimization, including linear regression
● Determine confidence intervals
● Formulate and test hypotheses


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



EDA of heritability
The array bd_parent_scandens contains the average beak depth (in mm) of two parents of the species G. scandens. The array bd_offspring_scandens contains the average beak depth of the offspring of the respective parents. The arrays bd_parent_fortis and bd_offspring_fortis contain the same information about measurements from G. fortis birds.

Make a scatter plot of the average offspring beak depth (y-axis) versus average parental beak depth (x-axis) for both species. Use the alpha=0.5 keyword argument to help you see overlapping points.

Instructions
100 XP
Generate scatter plots for both species. Display the data for G. fortis in blue and G. scandens in red.
Set the axis labels, make a legend, and show the plot.


# Make scatter plots
_ = plt.plot(bd_parent_fortis, bd_offspring_fortis,
             marker='.', linestyle='none', color='blue', alpha=0.5)
_ = plt.plot(bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens,
             marker='.', linestyle='none', color='red', alpha=0.5)

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('parental beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('offspring beak depth (mm)')

# Add legend
_ = plt.legend(('G. fortis', 'G. scandens'), loc='lower right')

# Show plot
plt.show()


It appears as though there is a stronger correlation in G. fortis than in G. scandens. This suggests that beak depth is more strongly inherited in G. fortis. We'll quantify this correlation next.

Correlation of offspring and parental data
In an effort to quantify the correlation between offspring and parent beak depths, we would like to compute statistics, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, between parents and offspring. To get confidence intervals on this, we need to do a pairs bootstrap.

You have already written a function to do pairs bootstrap to get estimates for parameters derived from linear regression. Your task in this exercise is to make a new function with call signature draw_bs_pairs(x, y, func, size=1) that performs pairs bootstrap and computes a single statistic on pairs samples defined. The statistic of interested in computed by calling func(bs_x, bs_y). In the next exercise, you will use pearson_r for func.

Set up an array of indices to sample from. (Remember, when doing pairs bootstrap, we randomly choose indices and use those to get the pairs.)
Initialize the array of bootstrap replicates. This should be a one-dimensional array of length size.
Write a for loop to draw the samples.
Randomly choose induces from the array of indices you previously set up.
Extract x values and y values from the input array using the indices you just chose to generate a bootstrap sample.
Use func to compute the statistic of interest from the bootstrap samples of x and y and store it in your array of bootstrap replicates.
Return the array of bootstrap replicates.


def draw_bs_pairs(x, y, func, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for a single statistic."""

    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))

    # Initialize replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[i], y[i]
        bs_replicates[i] = func(bs_x, bs_y)

    return bs_replicates
    
    

Hint
To set up the array of indices to sample from, use np.arange() with len(x), and then to initialize the empty array, use np.empty() with argument size. Store it in bs_replicates.
Inside the for loop, randomly generate indices with np.random.choice, where inds and len(inds) are the two arguments. Index x and y with these new indices and assign the result to bs_x and bs_y: These will be the arguments you pass into func, and the result of func should be stored in the bs_replicates array you initialized earlier!
bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps are not necessary here. Instead, you only need to return bs_replicates.

Pearson correlation of offspring and parental data
The Pearson correlation coefficient seems like a useful measure of how strongly the beak depth of parents are inherited by their offspring. Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between parental and offspring beak depths for G. scandens. Do the same for G. fortis. Then, use the function you wrote in the last exercise to compute a 95% confidence interval using pairs bootstrap.

Remember, the data are stored in bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens, bd_parent_fortis, and bd_offspring_fortis.

Instructions

Use the pearson_r() function you wrote in the prequel to this course to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient for G. scandens and G. fortis.
Acquire 1000 pairs bootstrap replicates of the Pearson correlation coefficient using the draw_bs_pairs() function you wrote in the previous exercise for G. scandens and G. fortis.
Compute the 95% confidence interval for both using your bootstrap replicates.


# Compute the Pearson correlation coefficients
r_scandens = pearson_r(bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens)
r_fortis = pearson_r(bd_parent_fortis, bd_offspring_fortis)

# Acquire 1000 bootstrap replicates of Pearson r
bs_replicates_scandens = draw_bs_pairs(bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens,pearson_r,1000)

bs_replicates_fortis = draw_bs_pairs(bd_parent_fortis,bd_offspring_fortis,pearson_r,1000)


# Compute 95% confidence intervals
conf_int_scandens = np.percentile(bs_replicates_scandens,[2.5,97.5])
conf_int_fortis = np.percentile(bs_replicates_fortis,[2.5,97.5])

# Print results
print('G. scandens:', r_scandens, conf_int_scandens)
print('G. fortis:', r_fortis, conf_int_fortis)

<script.py> output:
    G. scandens: 0.41170636294 [ 0.26564228  0.54388972]
    G. fortis: 0.728341239552 [ 0.6694112   0.77840616]
    
    
    It is clear from the confidence intervals that beak depth of the offspring of G. fortis parents is more strongly correlated with their offspring than their G. scandens counterparts.

Measuring heritability
Remember that the Pearson correlation coefficient is the ratio of the covariance to the geometric mean of the variances of the two data sets. This is a measure of the correlation between parents and offspring, but might not be the best estimate of heritability. If we stop and think, it makes more sense to define heritability as the ratio of the covariance between parent and offspring to the variance of the parents alone. In this exercise, you will estimate the heritability and perform a pairs bootstrap calculation to get the 95% confidence interval.

This exercise highlights a very important point. Statistical inference (and data analysis in general) is not a plug-n-chug enterprise. You need to think carefully about the questions you are seeking to answer with your data and analyze them appropriately. If you are interested in how heritable traits are, the quantity we defined as the heritability is more apt than the off-the-shelf statistic, the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Remember, the data are stored in bd_parent_scandens, bd_offspring_scandens, bd_parent_fortis, and bd_offspring_fortis.

Write a function heritability(parents, offspring) that computes heritability defined as the ratio of the covariance of the trait in parents and offspring divided by the variance of the trait in the parents. Hint: Remind yourself of the np.cov() function we covered in the prequel to this course.
Use this function to compute the heritability for G. scandens and G. fortis.
Acquire 1000 bootstrap replicates of the heritability using pairs bootstrap for G. scandens and G. fortis.
Compute the 95% confidence interval for both using your bootstrap replicates.
Print the results.


Hint
You have to be careful about how you index covariance_matrix. The covariance of the trait in parents and offspring can be accessed with the index [0,1] while the variance of the trait in the parents can be accessed with the index [0,0].
You can compute the heritability by passing in, for each species, first the parent array and then the offspring array as arguments to the heritability() function.
Use draw_bs_pairs() with heritability as the func argument to generate 1000 bootstrap replicates of the heritability for each species.
Use np.percentile() with the appropriate arguments to compute the 95% confidence intervals. Recall that this means you have to pass in 2.5 and 97.5 in the form of a list as an argument along with the relevant array.


<script.py> output:
    G. scandens: 0.548534086869 [ 0.34395487  0.75638267]
    G. fortis: 0.722905191144 [ 0.64655013  0.79688342]

Here again, we see that G. fortis has stronger heritability than G. scandens. This suggests that the traits of G. fortis may be strongly incorporated into G. scandens by introgressive hybridization.

Is beak depth heritable at all in G. scandens?
The heritability of beak depth in G. scandens seems low. It could be that this observed heritability was just achieved by chance and beak depth is actually not really heritable in the species. You will test that hypothesis here. To do this, you will do a pairs permutation test.

Instructions
100 XP
Initialize your array of replicates of heritability. We will take 10,000 pairs permutation replicates.
Write a for loop to generate your replicates.
Permute the bd_parent_scandens array using np.random.permutation().
Compute the heritability between the permuted array and the bd_offspring_scandens array using the heritability() function you wrote in the last exercise. Store the result in the replicates array.
Compute the p-value as the number of replicates that are greater than the observed heritability_scandens you computed in the last exercise.



# Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):
    # Permute parent beak depths
    bd_parent_permuted = np.random.permutation(bd_parent_scandens)
    perm_replicates[i] = heritability(bd_parent_permuted,
                                      bd_offspring_scandens)

# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= heritability_scandens) / len(perm_replicates)

# Print the p-value
print('p-val =', p)


You get a p-value of zero, which means that none of the 10,000 permutation pairs replicates you drew had a heritability high enough to match that which was observed. This strongly suggests that beak depth is heritable in G. scandens, just not as much as in G. fortis. If you like, you can plot a histogram of the heritability replicates to get a feel for how extreme of a value of heritability you might expect by chance.
