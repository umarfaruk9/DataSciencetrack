Spark and PySpark
Spark, a computing framework developed at Berkeley’s AMPLab by Matei Zaharia, has become one of the most prominent frameworks for running large-scale data analyses on computing clusters. In this section, you’ll learn Spark and Python tools and libraries that will give you a running start.


PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen when using Spark from Python. In this resource, you'll use this package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn to wrangle data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether flights will be late. Get ready to put some Spark in your Python code and dive into the world of high performance machine learning!

In this chapter, you'll learn how Spark manages data and how can you read and write tables from Python.

What is Spark, anyway?
Spark is a platform for cluster computing. Spark lets you spread data and computations over clusters with multiple nodes (think of each node as a separate computer). Splitting up your data makes it easier to work with very large datasets because each node only works with a small amount of data.

As each node works on its own subset of the total data, it also carries out a part of the total calculations required, so that both data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. It is a fact that parallel computation can make certain types of programming tasks much faster.

However, with greater computing power comes greater complexity.

Deciding whether or not Spark is the best solution for your problem takes some experience, but you can consider questions like:

Is my data too big to work with on a single machine?
Can my calculations be easily parallelized?
Are you excited to learn more about Spark?
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Using Spark in Python
The first step in using Spark is connecting to a cluster.

In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called the master that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called slaves. The master sends the slaves data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.

When you're just getting started with Spark it's simpler to just run a cluster locally. Thus, for this course, instead of connecting to another computer, all computations will be run on DataCamp's servers in a simulated cluster.

Creating the connection is as simple as creating an instance of the SparkContext class. The class constructor takes a few optional arguments that allow you to specify the attributes of the cluster you're connecting to.

An object holding all these attributes can be created with the SparkConf() constructor. Take a look at the documentation for all the details!

For the rest of this course you'll have a SparkContext called sc already available in your workspace.

How do you connect to a Spark cluster from PySpark?

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Examining The SparkContext
In this exercise you'll get familiar with the SparkContext.

You'll probably notice that code takes longer to run than you might expect. This is because Spark is some serious software. It takes more time to start up than you might be used to. You may also find that running simpler computations might take longer than expected. That's because all the optimizations that Spark has under its hood are designed for complicated operations with big data sets. That means that for simple or small problems Spark may actually perform worse than some other solutions!

Instructions
100 XP
Get to know the SparkContext.

Call print() on sc to verify there's a SparkContext in your environment.
print() sc.version to see what version of Spark is running on your cluster.


# Verify SparkContext
print(sc)

# Print Spark version
print(sc.version)

<script.py> output:
    <pyspark.context.SparkContext object at 0x7f95d16f4c18>
    2.1.0
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Using DataFrames
Spark's core data structure is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). This is a low level object that lets Spark work its magic by splitting data across multiple nodes in the cluster. However, RDDs are hard to work with directly, so in this course you'll be using the Spark DataFrame abstraction built on top of RDDs.

The Spark DataFrame was designed to behave a lot like a SQL table (a table with variables in the columns and observations in the rows). Not only are they easier to understand, DataFrames are also more optimized for complicated operations than RDDs.

When you start modifying and combining columns and rows of data, there are many ways to arrive at the same result, but some often take much longer than others. When using RDDs, it's up to the data scientist to figure out the right way to optimize the query, but the DataFrame implementation has much of this optimization built in!

To start working with Spark DataFrames, you first have to create a SparkSession object from your SparkContext. You can think of the SparkContext as your connection to the cluster and the SparkSession as your interface with that connection.

Remember, for the rest of this course you'll have a SparkSession called spark available in your workspace!


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Creating a SparkSession
We've already created a SparkSession for you called spark, but what if you're not sure there already is one? Creating multiple SparkSessions and SparkContexts can cause issues, so it's best practice to use the SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() method. This returns an existing SparkSession if there's already one in the environment, or creates a new one if necessary!

Instructions
100 XP
Import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.
Make a new SparkSession called my_spark using SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate().
Print my_spark to the console to verify it's a SparkSession.

# Import SparkSession from pyspark.sql
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create my_spark
my_spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Print my_spark
print(my_spark)

<script.py> output:
    <pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession object at 0x7f95be9b5198>
		
		_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		
		Viewing tables
Once you've created a SparkSession, you can start poking around to see what data is in your cluster!

Your SparkSession has an attribute called catalog which lists all the data inside the cluster. This attribute has a few methods for extracting different pieces of information.

One of the most useful is the .listTables() method, which returns the names of all the tables in your cluster as a list.

Instructions
100 XP
See what tables are in your cluster by calling spark.catalog.listTables() and printing the result!

# Print the tables in the catalog
print(spark.catalog.listTables())

<script.py> output:
    [Table(name='flights', database=None, description=None, tableType='TEMPORARY', isTemporary=True)]
		_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		
		Are you query-ious?
One of the advantages of the DataFrame interface is that you can run SQL queries on the tables in your Spark cluster. If you don't have any experience with SQL, don't worry (you can take our Introduction to SQL course!), we'll provide you with queries!

As you saw in the last exercise, one of the tables in your cluster is the flights table. This table contains a row for every flight that left Portland International Airport (PDX) or Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in 2014 and 2015.

Running a query on this table is as easy as using the .sql() method on your SparkSession. This method takes a string containing the query and returns a DataFrame with the results!

If you look closely, you'll notice that the table flights is only mentioned in the query, not as an argument to any of the methods. This is because there isn't a local object in your environment that holds that data, so it wouldn't make sense to pass the table as an argument.

Remember, we've already created a SparkSession called spark in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the .sql() method to get the first 10 rows of the flights table and save the result to flights10. The variable query contains the appropriate SQL query.
Use the DataFrame method .show() to print flights10.

# Don't change this query
query = "FROM flights SELECT * LIMIT 10"

# Get the first 10 rows of flights
flights10 = spark.sql(query)

# Show the results
flights10.show()

		Pandafy a Spark DataFrame
Suppose you've run a query on your huge dataset and aggregated it down to something a little more manageable.

Sometimes it makes sense to then take that table and work with it locally using a tool like pandas. Spark DataFrames make that easy with the .toPandas() method. Calling this method on a Spark DataFrame returns the corresponding pandas DataFrame. It's as simple as that!

This time the query counts the number of flights to each airport from SEA and PDX.

Remember, there's already a SparkSession called spark in your workspace!

Instructions
100 XP
Run the query using the .sql() method. Save the result in flight_counts.
Use the .toPandas() method on flight_counts to create a pandas DataFrame called pd_counts.
Print the .head() of pd_counts to the console.

# Don't change this query
query = "SELECT origin, dest, COUNT(*) as N FROM flights GROUP BY origin, dest"

# Run the query
flight_counts = spark.sql(query)

# Convert the results to a pandas DataFrame
pd_counts = flight_counts.toPandas()

# Print the head of pd_counts
print(pd_counts.head())

<script.py> output:
      origin dest    N
    0    SEA  RNO    8
    1    SEA  DTW   98
    2    SEA  CLE    2
    3    SEA  LAX  450
    4    PDX  SEA  144

		Put some Spark in your data
In the last exercise, you saw how to move data from Spark to pandas. However, maybe you want to go the other direction, and put a pandas DataFrame into a Spark cluster! The SparkSession class has a method for this as well.

The .createDataFrame() method takes a pandas DataFrame and returns a Spark DataFrame.

The output of this method is stored locally, not in the SparkSession catalog. This means that you can use all the Spark DataFrame methods on it, but you can't access the data in other contexts.

For example, a SQL query (using the .sql() method) that references your DataFrame will throw an error. To access the data in this way, you have to save it as a temporary table.

You can do this using the .createTempView() Spark DataFrame method, which takes as its only argument the name of the temporary table you'd like to register. This method registers the DataFrame as a table in the catalog, but as this table is temporary, it can only be accessed from the specific SparkSession used to create the Spark DataFrame.

There is also the method .createOrReplaceTempView(). This safely creates a new temporary table if nothing was there before, or updates an existing table if one was already defined. You'll use this method to avoid running into problems with duplicate tables.

Check out the diagram to see all the different ways your Spark data structures interact with each other.



There's already a SparkSession called spark in your workspace, numpy has been imported as np, and pandas as pd.

The code to create a pandas DataFrame of random numbers has already been provided and saved under pd_temp.
Create a Spark DataFrame called spark_temp by calling the .createDataFrame() method with pd_temp as the argument.
Examine the list of tables in your Spark cluster and verify that the new DataFrame is not present. Remember you can use spark.catalog.listTables() to do so.
Register spark_temp as a temporary table named "temp" using the .createOrReplaceTempView() method. Rememeber that the table name is set including it as the only argument!
Examine the list of tables again!


		# Create pd_temp
pd_temp = pd.DataFrame(np.random.random(10))

# Create spark_temp from pd_temp
spark_temp = spark.createDataFrame(pd_temp)

# Examine the tables in the catalog
print(spark.catalog.listTables())

# Add spark_temp to the catalog
spark_temp.createOrReplaceTempView("temp")

# Examine the tables in the catalog again
print(spark.catalog.listTables())

		Dropping the middle man
Now you know how to put data into Spark via pandas, but you're probably wondering why deal with pandas at all? Wouldn't it be easier to just read a text file straight into Spark? Of course it would!

Luckily, your SparkSession has a .read attribute which has several methods for reading different data sources into Spark DataFrames. Using these you can create a DataFrame from a .csv file just like with regular pandas DataFrames!

The variable file_path is a string with the path to the file airports.csv. This file contains information about different airports all over the world.

A SparkSession named spark is available in your workspace.

The first argument is file_path
Pass the argument header=True so that Spark knows to take the column names from the first line of the file.
Print out this DataFrame by calling .show().


		# Don't change this file path
file_path = "/usr/local/share/datasets/airports.csv"

# Read in the airports data
airports = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True)

In this chapter, you'll learn about the pyspark.sql module, which provides optimized data queries to your Spark session.


	_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		
		Creating columns
In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the methods defined by Spark's DataFrame class to perform common data operations.

Let's look at performing column-wise operations. In Spark you can do this using the .withColumn() method, which takes two arguments. First, a string with the name of your new column, and second the new column itself.

The new column must be an object of class Column. Creating one of these is as easy as extracting a column from your DataFrame using df.colName.

Updating a Spark DataFrame is somewhat different than working in pandas because the Spark DataFrame is immutable. This means that it can't be changed, and so columns can't be updated in place.

Thus, all these methods return a new DataFrame. To overwrite the original DataFrame you must reassign the returned DataFrame using the method like so:

df = df.withColumn("newCol", df.oldCol + 1)
The above code creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df plus a new column, newCol, where every entry is equal to the corresponding entry from oldCol, plus one.

To overwrite an existing column, just pass the name of the column as the first argument!

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace.

Use the spark.table() method with the argument "flights" to create a DataFrame containing the values of the flights table in the .catalog. Save it as flights.
Print the output of flights.show(). The column air_time contains the duration of the flight in minutes.
Update flights to include a new column called duration_hrs, that contains the duration of each flight in hours.


		# Create the DataFrame flights
flights = spark.table("flights")

# Show the head
print(flights.show())

# Add duration_hrs
flights = flights.withColumn("duration_hrs", flights.air_time / 60)

		SQL in a nutshell
As you move forward, it will help to have a basic understanding of SQL. A more in depth look can be found here.

A SQL query returns a table derived from one or more tables contained in a database.

Every SQL query is made up of commands that tell the database what you want to do with the data. The two commands that every query has to contain are SELECT and FROM.

The SELECT command is followed by the columns you want in the resulting table.

The FROM command is followed by the name of the table that contains those columns. The minimal SQL query is:

SELECT * FROM my_table;
The * selects all columns, so this returns the entire table named my_table.

Similar to .withColumn(), you can do column-wise computations within a SELECT statement. For example,

SELECT origin, dest, air_time / 60 FROM flights;
returns a table with the origin, destination, and duration in hours for each flight.

Another commonly used command is WHERE. This command filters the rows of the table based on some logical condition you specify. The resulting table contains the rows where your condition is true. For example, if you had a table of students and grades you could do:

SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade = 'A';
to select all the columns and the rows containing information about students who got As.


		
		
		_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		
		
		SQL in a nutshell (2)
Another common database task is aggregation. That is, reducing your data by breaking it into chunks and summarizing each chunk.

This is done in SQL using the GROUP BY command. This command breaks your data into groups and applies a function from your SELECT statement to each group.

For example, if you wanted to count the number of flights from each of two origin destinations, you could use the query

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights
GROUP BY origin;
GROUP BY origin tells SQL that you want the output to have a row for each unique value of the origin column. The SELECT statement selects the values you want to populate each of the columns. Here, we want to COUNT() every row in each of the groups.

It's possible to GROUP BY more than one column. When you do this, the resulting table has a row for every combination of the unique values in each column. The following query counts the number of flights from SEA and PDX to every destination airport:

SELECT origin, dest, COUNT(*) FROM flights
GROUP BY origin, dest;
The output will have a row for every combination of the values in origin and dest (i.e. a row listing each origin and destination that a flight flew to). There will also be a column with the COUNT() of all the rows in each group.

Remember, a more in depth look at SQL can be found here.

What information would this query get? Remember the flights table holds information about flights that departed PDX and SEA in 2014 and 2015. Note that AVG() function gets the average value of a column!

SELECT AVG(air_time) / 60 FROM flights
GROUP BY origin, carrier;
		
		_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		
	Filtering Data
Now that you have a bit of SQL know-how under your belt, it's easier to talk about the analogous operations using Spark DataFrames.

Let's take a look at the .filter() method. As you might suspect, this is the Spark counterpart of SQL's WHERE clause. The .filter() method takes either a Spark Column of boolean (True/False) values or the WHERE clause of a SQL expression as a string.

For example, the following two expressions will produce the same output:

flights.filter(flights.air_time > 120).show()
flights.filter("air_time > 120").show()
Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights.

Use the .filter() method to find all the flights that flew over 1000 miles two ways:
First, pass a SQL string to .filter() that checks the distance is greater than 1000. Save this as long_flights1.
Then pass a boolean column to .filter() that checks the same thing. Save this as long_flights2.
Print the .show() of both DataFrames and make sure they're actually equal!

# Filter flights with a SQL string
long_flights1 = flights.filter("distance > 1000")

# Filter flights with a boolean column
long_flights2 = flights.filter(flights.distance > 1000)

# Examine the data to check they're equal
print(long_flights1.show())
print(long_flights2.show())

Selecting
The Spark variant of SQL's SELECT is the .select() method. This method takes multiple arguments - one for each column you want to select. These arguments can either be the column name as a string (one for each column) or a column object (using the df.colName syntax). When you pass a column object, you can perform operations like addition or subtraction on the column to change the data contained in it, much like inside .withColumn().

The difference between .select() and .withColumn() methods is that .select() returns only the columns you specify, while .withColumn() returns all the columns of the DataFrame in addition to the one you defined. It's often a good idea to drop columns you don't need at the beginning of an operation so that you're not dragging around extra data as you're wrangling. In this case, you would use .select() and not .withColumn().

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights.

Instructions

Select the columns tailnum, origin, and dest from flights by passing the column names as strings. Save this as selected1.
Select the columns origin, dest, and carrier using the df.colName syntax and then filter the result using both of the filters already defined for you (filterA and filterB) to only keep flights from SEA to PDX. Save this as selected2.

# Select the first set of columns
selected1 = flights.select("tailnum","origin","dest")

# Select the second set of columns
temp = flights.select(flights.origin, flights.dest, flights.carrier)

# Define first filter
filterA = flights.origin == "SEA"

# Define second filter
filterB = flights.dest == "PDX"

# Filter the data, first by filterA then by filterB
selected2 = temp.filter(filterA).filter(filterB)

		
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________		
		
Selecting II
Similar to SQL, you can also use the .select() method to perform column-wise operations. When you're selecting a column using the df.colName notation, you can perform any column operation and the .select() method will return the transformed column. For example,

flights.select(flights.air_time/60)
returns a column of flight durations in hours instead of minutes. You can also use the .alias() method to rename a column you're selecting. So if you wanted to .select() the column duration_hrs (which isn't in your DataFrame) you could do

flights.select((flights.air_time/60).alias("duration_hrs"))
The equivalent Spark DataFrame method .selectExpr() takes SQL expressions as a string:

flights.selectExpr("air_time/60 as duration_hrs")
with the SQL as keyword being equivalent to the .alias() method. To select multiple columns, you can pass multiple strings.

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights.

Instructions

Create a table of the average speed of each flight both ways.

Calculate average speed by dividing the distance by the air_time (converted to hours). Use the .alias() method name this column "avg_speed". Save the output as the variable avg_speed.
Select the columns "origin", "dest", "tailnum", and avg_speed (without quotes!). Save this as speed1.
Create the same table using .selectExpr() and a string containing a SQL expression. Save this as speed2.
Take Hint (-30 XP)		

# Define avg_speed
avg_speed = (flights.distance/(flights.air_time/60)).alias("avg_speed")

# Select the correct columns
speed1 = flights.select("origin", "dest", "tailnum", avg_speed)

# Create the same table using a SQL expression
speed2 = flights.selectExpr("origin", "dest", "tailnum", "distance/(air_time/60) as avg_speed")

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Aggregating
All of the common aggregation methods, like .min(), .max(), and .count() are GroupedData methods. These are created by calling the .groupBy() DataFrame method. You'll learn exactly what that means in a few exercises. For now, all you have to do to use these functions is call that method on your DataFrame. For example, to find the minimum value of a column, col, in a DataFrame, df, you could do

df.groupBy().min("col").show()
This creates a GroupedData object (so you can use the .min() method), then finds the minimum value in col, and returns it as a DataFrame.

Now you're ready to do some aggregating of your own!

Use the .avg() method to get the average air time of Delta Airlines flights (where the carrier column has the value "DL") that left SEA. Th place of departure is stored in the column origin. show() the result.
Use the .sum() method to get the total number of hours all planes in this dataset spent in the air by creating a column called duration_hrs from the column air_time. show() the result.

# Average duration of Delta flights
flights.filter(flights.carrier == "DL").filter(flights.origin == "SEA").groupBy().avg("air_time").show()

# Total hours in the air
flights.withColumn("duration_hrs", flights.air_time/60).groupBy().sum("duration_hrs").show()

Grouping and Aggregating I
Part of what makes aggregating so powerful is the addition of groups. PySpark has a whole class devoted to grouped data frames: pyspark.sql.GroupedData, which you saw in the last two exercises.

You've learned how to create a grouped DataFrame by calling the .groupBy() method on a DataFrame with no arguments.

Now you'll see that when you pass the name of one or more columns in your DataFrame to the .groupBy() method, the aggregation methods behave like when you use a GROUP BY statement in a SQL query!

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights.

Create a DataFrame called by_plane that is grouped by the column tailnum.
Use the .count() method with no arguments to count the number of flights each plane made.
Create a DataFrame called by_origin that is grouped by the column origin.
Find the .avg() of the air_time column to find average duration of flights from PDX and SEA.

# Group by tailnum
by_plane = flights.groupBy("tailnum")

# Number of flights each plane made
by_plane.count().show()

# Group by origin
by_origin = flights.groupBy("origin")

Grouping and Aggregating II
In addition to the GroupedData methods you've already seen, there is also the .agg() method. This method lets you pass an aggregate column expression that uses any of the aggregate functions from the pyspark.sql.functions submodule.

This submodule contains many useful functions for computing things like standard deviations. All the aggregation functions in this submodule take the name of a column in a GroupedData table.

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace, along with the Spark DataFrame flights. The grouped DataFrames you created in the last exercise are also in your workspace.

Import the submodule pyspark.sql.functions as F.
Create a GroupedData table called by_month_dest that's grouped by both the month and dest columns. Refer to the two columns by passing both strings as separate arguments.
Use the .avg() method on the by_month_dest DataFrame to get the average dep_delay in each month for each destination.
Find the corresponding standard deviation of each average by using the .agg() method with the function F.stddev().

# Import pyspark.sql.functions as F
import pyspark.sql.functions as F

# Group by month and dest
by_month_dest = flights.groupBy("month","dest")

# Average departure delay by month and destination
by_month_dest.avg("dep_delay").show()

# Standard deviation
by_month_dest.agg(F.stddev("dep_delay")).show()

Joining
Another very common data operation is the join. Joins are a whole topic unto themselves, so in this course we'll just look at simple joins. If you'd like to learn more about joins, you can take a look here.

A join will combine two different tables along a column that they share. This column is called the key. Examples of keys here include the tailnum and carrier columns from the flights table.

For example, suppose that you want to know more information about the plane that flew a flight than just the tail number. This information isn't in the flights table because the same plane flies many different flights over the course of two years, so including this information in every row would result in a lot of duplication. To avoid this, you'd have a second table that has only one row for each plane and whose columns list all the information about the plane, including its tail number. You could call this table planes

When you join the flights table to this table of airplane information, you're adding all the columns from the planes table to the flights table. To fill these columns with information, you'll look at the tail number from the flights table and find the matching one in the planes table, and then use that row to fill out all the new columns.

Now you'll have a much bigger table than before, but now every row has all information about the plane that flew that flight!

Which of the following is not true?
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Joining II
In PySpark, joins are performed using the DataFrame method .join(). This method takes three arguments. The first is the second DataFrame that you want to join with the first one. The second argument, on, is the name of the key column(s) as a string. The names of the key column(s) must be the same in each table. The third argument, how, specifies the kind of join to perform. In this course we'll always use the value how="leftouter".

The flights dataset and a new dataset called airports are already in your workspace.

Examine the airports DataFrame by printing the .show(). Note which key column will let you join airports to the flights table.
Rename the faa column in airports to dest by re-assigning the result of airports.withColumnRenamed("faa", "dest") to airports.
Join the airports DataFrame to the flights DataFrame on the dest column by calling the .join() method on flights. Save the result as flights_with_airports.
The first argument should be the other DataFrame, airports.
The argument on should be the key column.
The argument how should be "leftouter".
Print the .show() of flights_with_airports. Note the new information that has been added.


# Examine the data
print(airports.show())

# Rename the faa column
airports = airports.withColumnRenamed("faa", "dest")

# Join the DataFrames
flights_with_airports = flights.join(airports, on="dest", how="leftouter")

# Examine the data again
print(flights_with_airports.show())

Getting started with machine learning pipelines
0%
PySpark provides cutting edge machine learning routines built in, along with utilities for creating full machine learning pipelines. You'll learn about them in this chapter.


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Machine Learning Pipelines
In the next two chapters you'll step through every stage of the machine learning pipeline, from data intake to model evaluation. Let's get to it!

At the core of the pyspark.ml module are the Transformer and Estimator classes. Almost every other class in the module behaves similarly to these two basic classes.

Transformer classes have a .transform() method that takes a DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame; usually the original one with a new column appended. For example, you might use the class Bucketizer to create discrete bins from a continuous feature or the class PCA to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset using principal component analysis.

Estimator classes all implement a .fit() method. These methods also take a DataFrame, but instead of returning another DataFrame they return a model object. This can be something like a StringIndexerModel for including categorical data saved as strings in your models, or a RandomForestModel that uses the random forest algorithm for classification or regression.



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Join the DataFrames
In the next two chapters you'll be working to build a model that predicts whether or not a flight will be delayed based on the flights data we've been working with. This model will also include information about the plane that flew the route, so the first step is to join the two tables: flights and planes!

Instructions
100 XP
First, rename the year column of planes to plane_year to avoid duplicate column names.
Create a new DataFrame called model_data by joining the flights table with planes using the tailnum column as the key.

# Rename year column
planes = planes.withColumnRenamed("year","plane_year")

# Join the DataFrames
model_data = flights.join(planes, on="tailnum", how="leftouter")
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Data types
Good work! Before you get started modeling, it's important to know that Spark only handles numeric data. That means all of the columns in your DataFrame must be either integers or decimals (called 'doubles' in Spark).

When we imported our data, we let Spark guess what kind of information each column held. Unfortunately, Spark doesn't always guess right and you can see that some of the columns in our DataFrame are strings containing numbers as opposed to actual numeric values.

To remedy this, you can use the .cast() method in combination with the .withColumn() method. It's important to note that .cast() works on columns, while .withColumn() works on DataFrames.

The only argument you need to pass to .cast() is the kind of value you want to create, in string form. For example, to create integers, you'll pass the argument "integer" and for decimal numbers you'll use "double".

You can put this call to .cast() inside a call to .withColumn() to overwrite the already existing column, just like you did in the previous chapter!



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
String to integer
Now you'll use the .cast() method you learned in the previous exercise to convert all the appropriate columns from your DataFrame model_data to integers!

To convert the type of a column using the .cast() method, you can write code like this:

dataframe = dataframe.withColumn("col", dataframe.col.cast("new_type")
Instructions
100 XP
Use the method .withColumn() to .cast() the following columns to type "integer". Access the columns using the df.col notation.
model_data.arr_delay
model_data.air_time
model_data.month
model_data.plane_year

# Cast the columns to integers
model_data = model_data.withColumn("arr_delay", model_data.arr_delay.cast("integer"))
model_data = model_data.withColumn("air_time", model_data.air_time.cast("integer"))
model_data = model_data.withColumn("month", model_data.month.cast("integer"))
model_data = model_data.withColumn("plane_year", model_data.plane_year.cast("integer"))


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Create a new column
In the last exercise, you converted the column plane_year to an integer. This column holds the year each plane was manufactured. However, your model will use the planes' age, which is slightly different from the year it was made!

Instructions
100 XP
Create the column plane_age using the .withColumn() method and subtracting the year of manufacture (column plane_year) from the year (column year) of the flight.


# Create the column plane_age
model_data = model_data.withColumn("plane_age", model_data.year - model_data.plane_year)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Making a Boolean
Consider that you're modeling a yes or no question: is the flight late? However, your data contains the arrival delay in minutes for each flight. Thus, you'll need to create a boolean column which indicates whether the flight was late or not!

Instructions
100 XP
Use the .withColumn() method to create the column is_late. This column is equal to model_data.arr_delay > 0.
Convert this column to an integer column so that you can use it in your model and name it label (this is the default name for the response variable in Spark's machine learning routines).
Filter out missing values (this has been done for you).

# Create is_late
model_data = model_data.withColumn("is_late", model_data.arr_delay > 0)

# Convert to an integer
model_data = model_data.withColumn("label", model_data.is_late.cast("integer"))

# Remove missing values
model_data = model_data.filter("arr_delay is not NULL and dep_delay is not NULL and air_time is not NULL and plane_year is not NULL")
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Strings and factors
As you know, Spark requires numeric data for modeling. So far this hasn't been an issue; even boolean columns can easily be converted to integers without any trouble. But you'll also be using the airline and the plane's destination as features in your model. These are coded as strings and there isn't any obvious way to convert them to a numeric data type.

Fortunately, PySpark has functions for handling this built into the pyspark.ml.features submodule. You can create what are called 'one-hot vectors' to represent the carrier and the destination of each flight. A one-hot vector is a way of representing a categorical feature where every observation has a vector in which all elements are zero except for at most one element, which has a value of one (1).

Each element in the vector corresponds to a level of the feature, so it's possible to tell what the right level is by seeing which element of the vector is equal to one (1).

The first step to encoding your categorical feature is to create a StringIndexer. Members of this class are Estimators that take a DataFrame with a column of strings and map each unique string to a number. Then, the Estimator returns a Transformer that takes a DataFrame, attaches the mapping to it as metadata, and returns a new DataFrame with a numeric column corresponding to the string column.

The second step is to encode this numeric column as a one-hot vector using a OneHotEncoder. This works exactly the same way as the StringIndexer by creating an Estimator and then a Transformer. The end result is a column that encodes your categorical feature as a vector that's suitable for machine learning routines!

This may seem complicated, but don't worry! All you have to remember is that you need to create a StringIndexer and a OneHotEncoder, and the Pipeline will take care of the rest.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Carrier
In this exercise you'll create a StringIndexer and a OneHotEncoder to code the carrier column. To do this, you'll call the class constructors with the arguments inputCol and outputCol.

The inputCol is the name of the column you want to index or encode, and the outputCol is the name of the new column that the Transformer should create.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a StringIndexer called carr_indexer by calling StringIndexer() with inputCol="carrier" and outputCol="carrier_index".
Create a OneHotEncoder called carr_encoder by calling OneHotEncoder() with inputCol="carrier_index" and outputCol="carrier_fact".

# Create a StringIndexer
carr_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="carrier",outputCol="carrier_index")

# Create a OneHotEncoder
carr_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="carrier_index",outputCol="carrier_fact")

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Destination
Now you'll encode the dest column just like you did in the previous exercise.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a StringIndexer called dest_indexer by calling StringIndexer() with inputCol="dest" and outputCol="dest_index".
Create a OneHotEncoder called dest_encoder by calling OneHotEncoder() with inputCol="dest_index" and outputCol="dest_fact".

# Create a StringIndexer
dest_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="dest",outputCol="dest_index")

# Create a OneHotEncoder
dest_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="dest_index",outputCol="dest_fact")


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Assemble a vector
Good work so far!

The last step in the Pipeline is to combine all of the columns containing our features into a single column. This has to be done before modeling can take place because every Spark modeling routine expects the data to be in this form. You can do this by storing each of the values from a column as an entry in a vector. Then, from the model's point of view, every observation is a vector that contains all of the information about it and a label that tells the modeler what value that observation corresponds to.

Because of this, the pyspark.ml.feature submodule contains a class called VectorAssembler. This Transformer takes all of the columns you specify and combines them into a new vector column.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a VectorAssembler by calling VectorAssembler() with the inputCols names as a list and the outputCol name "features".
The list of columns should be ["month", "air_time", "carrier_fact", "dest_fact", "plane_age"].

# Make a VectorAssembler
vec_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["month", "air_time", "carrier_fact", "dest_fact", "plane_age"], outputCol="features")

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Create the pipeline
You're finally ready to create a Pipeline!

Pipeline is a class in the pyspark.ml module that combines all the Estimators and Transformers that you've already created. This lets you reuse the same modeling process over and over again by wrapping it up in one simple object. Neat, right?

Instructions
100 XP
Import Pipeline from pyspark.ml.
Call the Pipeline() constructor with the keyword argument stages to create a Pipeline called flights_pipe.
stages should be a list holding all the stages you want your data to go through in the pipeline. Here this is just [dest_indexer, dest_encoder, carr_indexer, carr_encoder, vec_assembler]

# Import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

# Make the pipeline
flights_pipe = Pipeline(stages=[dest_indexer, dest_encoder, carr_indexer, carr_encoder, vec_assembler])

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Test vs Train
After you've cleaned your data and gotten it ready for modeling, one of the most important steps is to split the data into a test set and a train set. After that, don't touch your test data until you think you have a good model! As you're building models and forming hypotheses, you can test them on your training data to get an idea of their performance.

Once you've got your favorite model, you can see how well it predicts the new data in your test set. This never-before-seen data will give you a much more realistic idea of your model's performance in the real world when you're trying to predict or classify new data.

In Spark it's important to make sure you split the data after all the transformations. This is because operations like StringIndexer don't always produce the same index even when given the same list of strings.


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Transform the data
Hooray, now you're finally ready to pass your data through the Pipeline you created!

Instructions
100 XP
Create the DataFrame piped_data by calling the Pipeline methods .fit() and .transform() in a chain. Both of these methods take model_data as their only argument.

# Fit and transform the data
piped_data = flights_pipe.fit(model_data).transform(model_data)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Split the data
Now that you've done all your manipulations, the last step before modeling is to split the data!

Instructions
100 XP
Use the DataFrame method .randomSplit() to split model_data into two pieces, training with 60% of the data, and test with 40% of the data by passing the list [.6, .4] to the .randomSplit() method.

# Split the data into training and test sets
training, test = piped_data.randomSplit([.6, .4])

Model tuning and selection

In this last chapter, you'll apply what you've learned to create a model that predicts what flights will be delayed!


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


What is logistic regression?
The model you'll be fitting in this chapter is called a logistic regression. This model is very similar to a linear regression, but instead of predicting a numeric variable, it predicts the probability (between 0 and 1) of an event.

To use this as a classification algorithm, all you have to do is assign a cutoff point to these probabilities. If the predicted probability is above the cutoff point, you classify that observation as a 'yes' (in this case, the flight being late), if it's below, you classify it as a 'no'!

You'll tune this model by testing different values for several hyperparameters. A hyperparameter is just a value in the model that's not estimated from the data, but rather is supplied by the user to maximize performance. For this course it's not necessary to understand the mathematics behind all of these values - what's important is that you'll try out a few different choices and pick the best one.


# Import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# Create a LogisticRegression Estimator
lr = LogisticRegression()

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Cross validation
In the next few exercises you'll be tuning your logistic regression model using a procedure called k-fold cross validation. This is a method of estimating the model's performance on unseen data (like your test DataFrame).

It works by splitting the training data into a few different partitions. The exact number is up to you, but in this course you'll be using PySpark's default value of three. Once the data is split up, one of the partitions is set aside, and the model is fit to the others. Then the error is measured against the held out partition. This is repeated for each of the partitions, so that every block of data is held out and used as a test set exactly once. Then the error on each of the partitions is averaged. This is called the cross validation error of the model, and is a good estimate of the actual error on the held out data.

You'll be using cross validation to choose the hyperparameters by creating a grid of the possible pairs of values for the two hyperparameters, elasticNetParam and regParam, and using the cross validation error to compare all the different models so you can choose the best one!

What does cross validation allow you to estimate?


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Exercise
Exercise
Create the evaluator
The first thing you need when doing cross validation for model selection is a way to compare different models. Luckily, the pyspark.ml.evaluation submodule has classes for evaluating different kinds of models. Your model is a binary classification model, so you'll be using the BinaryClassificationEvaluator from the pyspark.ml.evaluation module.

This evaluator calculates the area under the ROC. This is a metric that combines the two kinds of errors a binary classifier can make (false positives and false negatives) into a simple number. You'll learn more about this towards the end of the chapter!

Instructions
100 XP
Import the submodule pyspark.ml.evaluation as evals.
Create evaluator by calling evals.BinaryClassificationEvaluator() with the argument metricName="areaUnderROC".

# Import the evaluation submodule
import pyspark.ml.evaluation as evals

# Create a BinaryClassificationEvaluator
evaluator = evals.BinaryClassificationEvaluator(metricName="areaUnderROC")
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Make a grid
Next, you need to create a grid of values to search over when looking for the optimal hyperparameters. The submodule pyspark.ml.tuning includes a class called ParamGridBuilder that does just that (maybe you're starting to notice a pattern here; PySpark has a submodule for just about everything!).

You'll need to use the .addGrid() and .build() methods to create a grid that you can use for cross validation. The .addGrid() method takes a model parameter (an attribute of the model Estimator, lr, that you created a few exercises ago) and a list of values that you want to try. The .build() method takes no arguments, it just returns the grid that you'll use later.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Import the submodule pyspark.ml.tuning under the alias tune.
Call the class constructor ParamGridBuilder() with no arguments. Save this as grid.
Call the .addGrid() method on grid with lr.regParam as the first argument and np.arange(0, .1, .01) as the second argument. This second call is a function from the numpy module (imported as np) that creates a list of numbers from 0 to .1, incrementing by .01. Overwrite grid with the result.
Update grid again by calling the .addGrid() method a second time create a grid for lr.elasticNetParam that includes only the values [0, 1].
Call the .build() method on grid and overwrite it with the output.

# Import the tuning submodule
import pyspark.ml.tuning as tune

# Create the parameter grid
grid = tune.ParamGridBuilder()

# Add the hyperparameter
grid = grid.addGrid(lr.regParam, np.arange(0, .1, .01))
grid = grid.addGrid(lr.elasticNetParam, [0, 1])

# Build the grid
grid = grid.build()
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Make the validator
The submodule pyspark.ml.tuning also has a class called CrossValidator for performing cross validation. This Estimator takes the modeler you want to fit, the grid of hyperparameters you created, and the evaluator you want to use to compare your models.

The submodule pyspark.ml.tune has already been imported as tune. You'll create the CrossValidator by passing it the logistic regression Estimator lr, the parameter grid, and the evaluator you created in the previous exercises.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a CrossValidator by calling tune.CrossValidator() with the arguments:
estimator=lr
estimatorParamMaps=grid
evaluator=evaluator
Name this object cv.

# Create the CrossValidator
cv = tune.CrossValidator(estimator=lr,
               estimatorParamMaps=grid,
               evaluator=evaluator
               )

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Fit the model(s)
You're finally ready to fit the models and select the best one!

Unfortunately, cross validation is a very computationally intensive procedure. Fitting all the models would take too long on DataCamp.

To do this locally you would use the code

# Fit cross validation models
models = cv.fit(training)

# Extract the best model
best_lr = models.bestModel
Remember, the training data is called training and you're using lr to fit a logistic regression model. Cross validation selected the parameter values regParam=0 and elasticNetParam=0 as being the best. These are the default values, so you don't need to do anything else with lr before fitting the model.

Instructions
100 XP
Create best_lr by calling lr.fit() on the training data.
Print best_lr to verify that it's an object of the LogisticRegressionModel class.

# Call lr.fit()
best_lr = lr.fit(training)

# Print best_lr
print(best_lr)


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Evaluating binary classifiers
For this course we'll be using a common metric for binary classification algorithms call the AUC, or area under the curve. In this case, the curve is the ROC, or receiver operating curve. The details of what these things actually measure isn't important for this course. All you need to know is that for our purposes, the closer the AUC is to one (1), the better the model is!

If you've created a perfect binary classification model, what would the AUC be?



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Evaluate the model
Remember the test data that you set aside waaaaaay back in chapter 3? It's finally time to test your model on it! You can use the same evaluator you made to fit the model.

Instructions
100 XP
Use your model to generate predictions by applying best_lr.transform() to the test data. Save this as test_results.
Call evaluator.evaluate() on test_results to compute the AUC. Print the output.

# Use the model to predict the test set
test_results = best_lr.transform(test)

# Evaluate the predictions
print(evaluator.evaluate(test_results))

Conclusion
Congrats on making it to the end of the course! You went from knowing nothing about Spark to doing advanced machine learning. Cool huh?

The next steps are learning how to create large scale Spark clusters and manage and submit jobs so that you can use models in the real world.

And remember, Spark is still being actively developed, so there's new features coming all the time!

Did you have a great time taking this course?
